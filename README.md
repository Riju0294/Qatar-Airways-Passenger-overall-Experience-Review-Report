**KRA (KEY RESULT AREA) of QATAR AVIATION**
Business & Economy Class Passenger Experience needs to be Upgraded
Business Travelers/Passengers should be more prioritized in terms addressing and resolving escalations/issues on time
Company Should resolve top tagged Reviews to get better ratings
Asia, Middle East and Central Europe could be the next most targeted customer base
Among top rated Aircraft few (Boing 787, 777, etc.) needs to be monitored in terms of providing better experience
In last 8-10 years both 10 (Excellent) Star & 1 (Worst) Star Rating Deteriorate than expected, hence Management should work on shortfalls
Very less or 0 booking in First Class and Premium Economy Class compare to other class, so company should start promoting more in these segment to get more customers
65% of total customer are coming from Economy class (Family & Solo Leisure) except Qatar (Business Class), so company should prioritized Economy class  in terms of resolving most escalated issues at the earliest and promote Business class as well to enhance the business
